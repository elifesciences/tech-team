# Python application building and deployment

Date: 2019-01-30

## Status

Proposed

## Context 

Python and Python applications are a mess to install and run. 

It would be better in all respects if we dealt with them from within a container.

## Decision

Test and deploy all Python projects within containers.

## Consequences

Testing becomes simpler and deployment less hazardous.
