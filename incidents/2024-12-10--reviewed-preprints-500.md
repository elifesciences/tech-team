# 2024-12-10 - Reviewed Preprints 500 Error

**Incident Leader: [Your Name Here]**

## Description

Users were unable to access Reviewed Preprints pages on December 10th due to persistent 500 Internal Server Errors. The issue was caused by a failure in handling non-standard response codes from the Metrics API. This resulted in all Reviewed Preprints pages being inaccessible to users, with no fallback from caching or the CDN.

* 08:54: Fred reports the issue in the `#incident-response` Slack channel, stating all Reviewed Preprints pages are returning 500 errors. He includes a screenshot.
* 09:05: Ash acknowledges the error in `#incident-response` and posts in `#epp-team-babbage` to call on developers for investigation.
* 09:34: Aisha responds in `#epp-team-babbage` stating she has restarted the deployments but is unsure of the source of the problem.
* 09:36: Hazal offers assistance to pair on debugging.
* 09:38: Aisha identifies the error as originating from the server application and suggests pairing with Hazal to debug further. A Google Meet session is initiated.
* 10:00: The team confirms the issue is with the server application. Aisha begins reviewing recent commits to identify possible causes.
* 10:05: Aisha reverts a renovate commit (`fix(deps): update dependency @smithy/util-stream to v3.3.2`) merged at 10:46 PM on December 9th to rule out its involvement. This does not resolve the issue.
* 10:11: Ash provides an update in Slack: "Aisha has locally reverted a server utility function commit, but the error persists."
* 10:50?: The team identifies that the 500 errors are caused by a request made to the Metrics API, which fails to handle non-standard response codes (e.g., 2xx, 404).
* 10:53: Ash updates the team: "We've identified a Metrics API upgrade completed yesterday may be the root cause. We are working to resolve the issue and ensure such upgrades donâ€™t cause the same impact in the future."
* 11:00: A fix is committed to the server application to log errors from Metrics API requests instead of throwing them: [Commit: 4dad1f1](https://github.com/elifesciences/enhanced-preprints-server/commit/4dad1f10622070fbefa6b42a3c4bca3dbdeac115).
* 11:17: The fix is deployed to staging, resolving the 500 errors. Reviewed Preprints pages are visible again without metrics data.
* 11:22: The fix is deployed to production, resolving the issue for all users. Reviewed Preprints pages are accessible but do not display metrics.
