# How to hold a productive meeting

An outcome of a retrospective on 01/04/2019 was to, as part of our continuous improvement, share good practices for holding productive meetings.

- **State the objective** - define the goal at the start of the meeting, and ahead of time in the invitation. What do you want the outcome to be?

- **Agendas** - if you have an agenda, then share it ahead of time, and stick to it

- **Who needs to attend?** - signal in a meeting invitation the people that are required and optional so people can make an informed choice whether to attend

- **Choose a facilitator** - if you're creating the meeting the facilitator is you, by default, so ensure you're up for that, if not, ask someone else, giving them time to prepare

- **Set an appropriate length** - meetings are like gases, they'll fill any space they're given. If you only need 15 minutes then only book that time. Here are some interesting examples around using 22 minute meetings: https://scottberkun.com/2010/the-22-minute-meeting/

- **Limit laptop use** - sometimes you need laptops but most of the time you don't

- **Think about furniture** - a quick meeting can be done standing up which helps people focus. A discussion is best in an open area (i.e. not across a table) and always ensure everyone can see everyone else. The rectangular tables in our meeting rooms collapse easily and we've tried to minimise wires.

- **Interactivity always helps** - think about the format. Retrospectives are a good example of where an interactive format helps engagement. There's a copy of Gamestorming in the office but it's also a good online list: https://gamestorming.com/
