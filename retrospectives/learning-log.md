# Retrospect Learning Log

## Purpose
A easily editable log of team-wide process or practice updates observed as actions in retrospectives. Once a new practice or process has been tried we should keep a log of it here so that we can remember to keep up the improved way of doing things.

Anything that is a tenet of how we work can be recorded in an [ADR](https://github.com/elifesciences/tech-team/tree/master/adr) elsewhere in this repository. These are more just general reminders.

## Log

- Check specifications in tickets (especially for old tickets) to check it is needed and described correctly.
- Create spikes for risky or large tickets
- Specify reasons for tickets taking a long time (greater than 2 days)
- Decide and document how the team communicates on project kick-off - particularly when collaborating with other organisations or teams
- Decide and document the preference for getting pull requests in early and branches over forks on project kick-off - particularly when collaborating with other organisations or teams
- Identify opportunities for prototyping:
  - for front-end
  - with dummy data
- Write feature files before a deliverable is started
- Celebrate more when a feature is done!
- Write _deprecated_ in a repository README if it's intended to be retired, and [archive it](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-repositories/) when it can become read only and is not deployed anywhere anymore.
